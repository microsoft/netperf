# Network Perfomance Testing

The repo is the common place other Microsoft owned networking projects (including Windows itself) use to run, store and visualize networking performance testing. Currently, the following projects (will) use this:

- [microsoft/msquic](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic)
- [microsoft/xdp-for-Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/xdp-for-windows)
- [microsoft/ebpf-for-Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows)
- [Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/)

## Goal

Historically, networking performance testing has been spotty, inconsistent, not reproducable, and not easily accessible.  Different groups or projects test performance in different ways, on different hardware.  They even have different definitions of things like throughput and latency.  This repo aims to fix that by providing a common, open place to run, store, and visualize networking performance testing.  The end result is ultimately a set of dashboards summarizing the performance of the various projects, across various scenarios, and across various platforms.
