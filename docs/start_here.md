**I want to onboard my project's multi-machine (client/server) performance tests to Netperf.** See: [onboard.md](onboard.md)

**I am currently in the process of onboarding my multi-machine performance tests... I want to leverage Netperf's on-prem lab.** See: [lab_consumption.md](lab_consumption.md)

**I am currently in the process of onboarding my multi-machine performance tests... I want to leverage Azure VMs.** Open an issue for support here. Due to security and other restrictions, Netperf has had to build a number of work-arounds to facilitate multi-machine performance tests leveraging 1ES pools. The end result is quite satisfactory, but complex. See [internal/1es-p2p-communication.md](internal/1es-p2p-communication.md), `/netperf-1es-syncer`, [internal/thread-model.md](internal/threat-model.md)

**I want to learn how Netperf handles lab engineeering systems.**
 See: [lab_management.md](lab_management.md)

 **I am a maintainer of Netperf. I have some extra hardware I would like to add to the Netperf bench.** See [lab_management.md](lab_management.md), then [machines.md](machines.md).

 **Give me the high level overview of Netperf's architecture.** See: [arch.md](arch.md)

**What questions we are trying to answer with Netperf?**
